# Oceanic Plus Plus

Color and UI theme based on the excellent Oceanic Plus, with some minor syntax updates and adjustments. Also supports semantic highlighting for a better developer experience.

Mostly optimized for use in Typescript, but also works well in other languages.

I personally use this color theme with the font [Operator Mono Lig](https://github.com/kiliman/operator-mono-lig) and the extension [Bracket Pair Colorizer 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2)
